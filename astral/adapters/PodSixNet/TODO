* automatic load testing script

IMHO, the example code would be clearer and/or easier to test if:

- it never used "import *" (this makes it hard to figure out what is
actually being used, from where);

- there were another couple of examples (as it is, I can only try the chat
example since I don't have pygame installed);

- the examples would grab IP address and port from sys.argv (using default
values for missing arguments) rather than relying on default values buried
inside the library functions.

The docs would be clearer if the customizable part of the method names was
made more explicit in the docs. (I forget the exact string used for that
part since I don't have the docs in front of me right now. I think it
started with "my".)

The only big missing feature I've noticed is letting a client connect to
more than one server. (I have use cases for this, though they are not
"multiplayer games".)

The chat example uses about 3.5% CPU when doing nothing (I think that was
true for both server and client; on Mac Leopard), not affected by changing
the sleep times to 0.01. This is ok, but mysterious, and might not always be
ok. Probably it should be documented (and explained if possible).
